routines
1. BuildMentalModel
    - Build resource database
        - Figure out which files are source files
        - Analyze each source file
        - Build file store
            - file types: knowledge, source
            - build mirror repo, each file gets it's own json counter part
                - ie main.go -> main.go.json
                - summary
                - file type (source, knowledge, blob)
                - source type
                    - definitions
                        - symbol name
                        - symbol summary
                - knowledge
                    - key points
                    - relevance score
                - blob
                    - context
            - second mirror repo for diffs (diff repo)
                - diff the orignal files with their diff repo counterparts
                - check what changed, re-evaluate those files


    - Build mental model of how repo works
        - which files are the most important?
        - how do they interact?
        - Create chart describing repo

    X- Install LSP/hack lsp?
    X- Think about method for testing and verifying changes
    X- Use LSP to jump around repo and look for errors

    - Goto StopAndThink
